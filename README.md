# Mobile-App-Development CM3131 Module

Developed by @Kinga Kloskowska (2209820)

This application was created to fufill the assessment requirements for [Module 2023/2024] CM3131 - Mobile Application Design And Development. 

The concept behind the application, was originally fueled by the UN Sustainable Development goals, closely following the assessment theme "Sustainability". The focus was settled on the goal "11" - Sustainable cities and communities which focuses on exploring the concept of air pollution and how to fight against it. 

The objective here is to allow users to view exactly how much air pollution every country or city produces at the moment, displaying key parameters when it comes to pollution of this type. Allowing for further research and questions regarding how to minimize those numbers and reduce the devastating effects of this controversy.

The application development and API usage was supported through https://leafletjs.com/reference.html (Map creation and display of information) as well as https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution (API showcasing air pollution levels). 

# How to use the app

The application is utilising simple UI design to provide the easiest usability of the software. 

User is required to click on the map (first page of the app), on any space within the map. Moving onto the "Pollution" tab on the bottom panel that will showcase the current coordinates, name of the location as well as the most important metrics when it comes to air pollution. At any point the user can remove the marker by clicking on it again, while placing another marker on the map the information displayed will change accordingly. The user can also access the settings tab that allows for selection between the key parameters based on their own preference.
